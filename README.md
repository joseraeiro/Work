# Work

This is just a repository for some of the projects that I did while working at my current job as a Security Engineer

# Highligts

1 - Python PyVirustotalFileUpload

A simple script to use your Virus Total API (get one free here: https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002088769-Please-give-me-an-API-key) to automatically send files for checking within the VirusTotal database. It reads all the files contained in the specified directory and sends them to VirusTotal.

Please bear in my mind that it requires vt-py to work. https://virustotal.github.io/vt-py/ and how to install https://virustotal.github.io/vt-py/howtoinstall.html

2 - Rules created in Wazuh while trying to reduce the Sysmon false positives in a Domain Controller and other Windows Servers.

File: rules_sysmon_comExcepcoes.xml

You can just copy paste into a new rules file inside Wazuh!
