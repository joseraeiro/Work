1 - Python PyVirustotalFileUpload

A simple script to use your Virus Total API (get one free here: https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002088769-Please-give-me-an-API-key) to automatically send files for checking withing VirusTotal database. It reads all the files contained in the specified directory and sends them to VirusTotal.

Please bear in my mind that it requires vt-py to work. https://virustotal.github.io/vt-py/ and how to install https://virustotal.github.io/vt-py/howtoinstall.html

2 - Rules created in Wazuh while trying to reduce the Sysmon false positives in a Domain Controller and other Windows Servers.

You can just copy paste into a new rules file inside Wazuh!
